    "# Resource Allocation in a Fast-Food Setting\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "A fast-food restaurant has to decide how to allocate its resources among three main sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1.  Cooking: Preparing the main items (burgers, wraps, etc.)\n",
    "  2.  Assembly: Assembling the items together (adding sauces, making combos, etc.)\n",
    "  3.  Serving: Taking orders and serving to the customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to maximize customer satisfaction, which depends on the efficiency of these sections. If any section is slow, it can bottleneck the whole process and decrease customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There are a total of 15 employees in the restaurant and each section needs at least 3 employees. Each employee can only be assigned to one section.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every employee has a different efficiency rate for each section, ranging from 0 to 1. A higher efficiency rate means the employee is more suitable for that section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The customer satisfaction is calculated as the product of the average efficiency rates of the employees in each section.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Objective: Allocate employees to sections in such a way that the customer satisfaction is maximized.\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Assumptions:\n",
    "All employees work the same hours.\n",
    "The efficiency of a section is simply the average of the efficiency of its employees.\n",
    "The number of employees in a section doesn't affect its efficiency beyond the employee's individual efficiencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Difference between Monte Carlo and Genetic Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "While both Monte Carlo and Genetic Algorithms involve randomness:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Monte Carlo**:\n",
    "    - Completely random sampling.\n",
    "    - Each sample (or solution) is independent of the others.\n",
    "    - May require many samples to get a good solution.\n",
    "    - Does not \"learn\" from one iteration to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Genetic Algorithm**:\n",
    "    - Begins with randomness but introduces \"evolution.\"\n",
    "    - Solutions improve over iterations.\n",
    "    - Uses \"mating\" and \"mutations\" to produce new solutions.\n",
    "    - Learns from previous solutions: good solutions produce offspring.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the fast-food problem, Monte Carlo would generate a large number of assignment randomly. In contrast, the Genetic Algorithm would start with a set of random assufbnebt, then iteratively refine and evolve these assignment to find better ones over time."
