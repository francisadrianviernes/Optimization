# Optimization
Welcome to the Optimization repository! This is a collection of optimization codes, started with my desire as an educator to understand the behind-the-scenes of the most popular algorithms in Optimization and to provide resources to my students. I have provided real-world cases that readers and visitors can modify according to their specific needs although most of them revolving in the Finance industry.

## üéØ Overview
Optimization is simply about finding the best course of action for a given problem.

## üìÇ Contents

The repository is structured into different sections, covering various facets of optimization:

- [**Linear Programming**](https://github.com/francisadrianviernes/Optimization/tree/main/Linear%20Programming)
- [**Non-Linear Programming**](./Optimization/Non-Linear%20Programming)
- [**Integer Programming**](./Optimization/Integer%20Programming)
- [**Dynamic Programming**](./Optimization/Dynamic%20Programming)
- [**Stochastic Optimization**](./Optimization/Stochastic%20Optimization)
- [**Heuristic and Metaheuristic Algorithms**](./Optimization/Heuristic%20and%20Metaheuristic%20Algorithms)
- ... and many more!

- ## üí° How to Use

1. **Browse Through Folders**: Each folder corresponds to a different optimization technique or topic. Start with the one you're most interested in.
2. **Run Code**: Most of the codes are provided with sample data. You can run them to see how they perform and then modify or tweak as per your requirements.
3. **Read Comments**: The codes come with comprehensive comments to help you understand each step of the optimization process.
4. **Contribute**: Feel free to contribute by either improving existing codes, adding new ones, or even improving this documentation.

## üìö Prerequisites

- Familiarity with programming, preferably in Python or MATLAB (as most codes are written in these languages).
- Basic understanding of mathematical optimization concepts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

The codes might require specific libraries or toolboxes depending on the programming language used. Please ensure you check the comments or the respective `requirements.txt` file (for Python codes) before running the programs.

## üôå Contribution

Contributions are more than welcome! Here's how you can help:

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. Create a new **branch**.
3. Add or modify codes.
4. Create a **pull request**.

Before contributing, please ensure you have:

- Commented your code properly.
- Added a brief description of your contribution in the pull request.
